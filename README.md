Eagle CAD files for my BLDC motor controller

There are a number of problems with this board design as it is. There are traces missing for the hardware overcurrent protection control on the DRV8302, the footprint for the buck converter inductor is not right, and I want to have the option of just using a single shunt for current sensing. I'm sure there are other problems too.
